## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a **Software Developer** who enjoys designing systems that are reliable, maintainable, and built with long-term scalability in mind.

🎓 B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering – CUSAT  
💼 Currently working as **Project Engineer at Wipro**

My work revolves around understanding real-world problems, structuring clean backend logic, and building solutions that balance performance, security, and clarity.

I strongly believe software is not just about writing code —  
it is about designing systems that remain stable as they grow.
